# BlueBox
by Kelly Wang, Alex Salsali, Joanna Yang <br>

BlueBox identifies a waste item the user chooses and presents information on how to dispose of the item. Once the user selects an item, the program will ask the user a series of “Yes” or “No” questions to determine the item the user has chosen. When the program guesses the item correctly, it will give the user information about proper disposal of the item. <br>

Note: the G4P library and tool must be installed before running this program. <br>



<strong> Features </strong> <br>
●	Guess the Item <br>
Accurately and efficiently identifies the waste item the user is thinking of through a series of yes-no questions. 

●	Which Bin? <br>
Tells the user how to most sustainably dispose of the item, whether through the local recycling bin, green bin, garbage bin, or hazardous waste program. Takes toxicity, food contamination, and local regulations into account. 

●	Item Pathway <br>
Educates the user on how the item is recycled, and possible uses for the recycled material. If the item is not recyclable or compostable, provides information on the breakdown of the item, and suggests more sustainable alternatives. 

●	Save Information <br>
The user is able to take and save a picture of the information shown on the results screen. This allows the user to find information on how to dispose of the object easily.
